# GameOfLife-pygame
John Conway's Game of Life programmed to play in Python, pygame.

Current version doesn't include any boundary conditions. 
Boundary cells simply don't obey the game's rules.

# Controls
- Press left mouse button to change the state of the particular cell
- Press space bar to advance in time (unfortunately game is manual timewise)
- Press keyboard c to set every cell to default state (dead)
- Press esc to exit
